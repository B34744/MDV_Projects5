<p>The story of Jim the cat. One night Jim the cat wanted to eat his kitten mix. I was only going feed Jim the cat if and only if Jim had sixty seven bit's of kitten mix. If he had ninety seven, I would wait for Jim to eat the rest. I waited and waited till Jim was ready. I was happy in the end to feed Jim his sixty seven bits of kitten mix!</p>
